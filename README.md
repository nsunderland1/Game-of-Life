This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) I wrote back in highschool using C++ and Allegro.

## Installation

Requires Allegro

## Usage

Each initial configuration is a plaintext file that can be loaded on startup. The provided files can be used as examples for creating custom ones. Hitting Esc will end the simulation.

## Credits
